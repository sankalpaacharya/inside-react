This is a really good post. It sums up so much about React, in the post he mentions this which really had me thinking and it caught my interest to understand more about React

>react finally got freedom from the JS callstack. instead of recursive rendering, it’s this iterative stepping through fibers one by one. and that suddenly means react can pause. like just literally stop mid render, drop everything, let the browser repaint, handle input, chill, take a breath, then pick up exactly where it left off inside that huge UI tree. no more “oh no i’m stuck deep in recursion”. you can’t get stuck because react isn’t using the builtin stack anymore. it’s rolling its own

"react finally got freedom from the JS callstack" _hmm_

this is interesting because what problem would the JS callstack even have so that react had to get rid of it? 

To understand the solution, we have to know the problem: what was hindering React's performance, what the React team came up with.

# Story of a Single Thread

We know JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, and for each execution context it only has one thread and a call stack that processes
the code line by line. It starts processing from the top to bottom. 


```js 

function doSomethingHeavy() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1_000_000_000; i++) {} // blocks the thread
  
  console.log("Finished heavy task");
}

doSomethingHeavy();

do_important_task(); // important task
```

From the above example, once we start the `doSomethingHeavy` task it will run until it finishes, but let's say 
we have an important task below. Our important task is only executed once the `doSomethingHeavy` loop is finished. 

This is a simple synchronous program. JavaScript does support async programming as well, you have probably used `async` `await` in 
JavaScript. This is done by the [event loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Execution_model).

You might suggest we can swap the position of the `doSomethingHeavy()` and `do_important_task()` if we want `do_important_task` to be executed 
first, but right now we know what the important task is. You wrote that function, we know what to place where, but what if it was nondeterministic?

When you are running in the middle of a heavy task, a really important task pops up. You can't stop the running program in the middle and process something; 
you can't empty the call stack suddenly and start working on something else.

Let's see an example:

<Sandpack
template="react"
files={{
"/App.js": `import { useState } from "react";

export default function BlockingDemo() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [isBlocked, setIsBlocked] = useState(false);

  const blockThread = () => {
    setIsBlocked(true);
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      const start = Date.now();
      let dummy = 0;
      
      // Block for 3 seconds
      while (Date.now() - start < 3000) {
        dummy += Math.random();
      }
      
      setIsBlocked(false);
    }, 0);
  };

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="count">{count}</div>
      <div className="buttons">
        <button onClick={blockThread}>
          {isBlocked ? "Processing.." : "Start Work"}
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
          Click +1
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}`,
"/styles.css": `.container {
  padding: 30px;
  max-width: 350px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.count {
  font-size: 3rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  font-family: monospace;
}

.buttons {
  display: flex;
  gap: 10px;
}

button {
  flex: 1;
  padding: 12px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  background: white;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-size: 0.9rem;
}

button:hover {
  background: #f5f5f5;
}
`,
"/sandbox.config.json": `{
  "infiniteLoopProtection": false
}`
}}
/>

Try clicking the `click +1` after you press `start work`. `start work` takes 3 seconds to finish. In that time, even if you press 
the `click +1` button, the count doesn't increment instantly, you have to wait for 3 seconds. This feels laggy and is a 
bad user experience.


# React 15

React 15 reconciler walked the component tree using recursive function calls. Once it started, it couldn't stop

```jsx
function updateComponent(component) {
  const children = component.render();
  
  children.forEach(child => {
    updateComponent(child); // ← Recursion
  });
}
```

Every call to `updateComponent` pushes a new frame onto JavaScript's call stack. For a tree with 1,000 components, 
that's 1,000 stack frames, all nested inside each other.

<React15InputDemo />

Imagine there is an input box and whatever the user types in that input box will be reflected on screen. The 
user typed the first character `s`, React will start the rendering process, calling `updateComponent` inside `updateComponent`

doing recursive calls, your call stack is filled with function calls now. While halfway through, the user typed another 
letter `a`, but now you can't stop. It can't say _hold on, the user typed again, let me restart with the new input_ 

JavaScript has no mechanism to pause a call stack, save its state, and resume later. React has to finish processing `s` before it can even see that you 
typed `a`. Each keystroke triggers another full reconciliation. Each time, React is trapped in recursion while your inputs pile up.


This is why React apps felt laggy.

## Priority

<img src="/blog/fiber/rendering.png" alt="React UI Runtime" width="800" height="100" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto' }} />

There was a second problem. React treated all updates equally. A button click got the same priority as a background data fetch. 
An animation got the same priority as logging. 

But some updates are urgent (user typing, clicking) and some can wait (analytics, prefetching). React had no way to express 
this because once reconciliation started, it ran to completion. Everything was equally important because everything blocked 
everything else.

Let's say you fetch some data from the server, a list of 500 products. The response comes back, 
and React starts rendering those 500 items to the screen. Halfway through, maybe 250 products rendered, you type a letter 
in the search box.

What should React do?

Stop rendering those products. Handle the keystroke first. Update the input box immediately. That's what 
the user cares about, seeing their typing reflected instantly.

The products can wait. A 100ms delay in showing search results? Barely noticeable. But a 100ms delay in seeing your keystroke? 
That feels broken.



# What We Need

<img src="/blog/fiber/need.svg" alt="React UI Runtime" width="800" height="100" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto' }} />

Before we start looking for a solution we should be clear what we are looking for in a solution. 

We are facing two main problems with this recursive reconciliation approach: 
- we can't pause the rendering process in the middle (callstack level)
- we can't assume every update has the same priority 

so, our solution should be able to pause the rendering process if there is another high priority task, pick that up, 
render it first and continue working where it left off.


_why pause at callstack level?_

<img src="/blog/fiber/waiting.png" alt="React UI Runtime" width="800" height="100" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto' }} />



because that's how browsers work, unless your callstack is empty browser can't push the click, keystroke events 
from macro queue to the callstack.

so browser is just like _finish whatever you have in your plate and i will give you more_ but if your recursive 
functions take way too long to process, browser won't have the control to push those events in the callstack.

# Solution

<img src="/blog/fiber/solution.png" alt="React UI Runtime" width="800" height="100" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto' }} />

The React team eventually realized that the problem wasn't just the reconciliation algorithm itself, but how it was being executed.

No amount of small optimizations could fix this, because recursion 
in JavaScript is fundamentally non-interruptible.

Instead of trying to bend the JavaScript call stack into doing 
something it was never meant to do, React gave up on the recursive 
model entirely. They stopped letting the JS engine drive 
reconciliation and built their own abstraction on top of it.

That abstraction is Fiber.

Fiber doesn't control the callstack, nothing can, because the 
callstack is fundamentally built into JavaScript itself. What 
Fiber controls is how we structure and execute our rendering work.

Instead of running the whole render process at once recursively, 
React now divides the entire reconciliation into small units of 
work. React processes one unit, then returns 
control to the browser. The callstack clears. The browser handles 
any pending events. Then React comes back and processes the next 
unit.

This happens in small time slices. React works for ~5ms, then 
yields. The browser breathes. Then React continues where it left 
off.

The old Scheduler (pre-React 18-ish) used a fixed ~5 ms heuristic in some paths. Modern React [scheduler package](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/scheduler) is frame-aligned and dynamic. It tries to finish before the next frame deadline (~16.7 ms @60 fps, ~8.3 ms @120 fps), yielding earlier only when it knows a higher-priority event is pending or when it's safe.

how the react scheduler works can be a different topic of blog but for simplicity in this blog we will say ~5ms

# Fiber as a data structure

So React gave up on recursion. But if you're not using the call 
stack anymore, you need something else to track your progress through 
the component tree.

React needed a data structure it could own. Something it could walk 
through, pause in the middle of, and resume later. Something flexible. That's Fiber. yes, Fiber can refer to both a data structure and an algorithm, depending on the context: 

When you write your JSX components, React doesn't just render them 
directly. It first builds an in-memory representation of your entire 
UI tree. 

```javascript
const fiber = {
  type: 'div',           // What is this?
  
  child: h1Fiber,        // Pointer to first child
  sibling: buttonFiber,  // Pointer to next sibling  
  return: AppFiber,      // Pointer back to parent
  
  // ... lots of other stuff React needs
};
```

Each [fiber](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiber.js#L138-L211) represents one piece of your UI. A component. A div. A 
button. Whatever. See those three properties of fiber object? `child`, `sibling`, `return`. These are 
pointers. They connect fibers to other fibers, forming like a linked list.

put drawing and explain from the build your own react thing 

And here's why this matters: React owns this data structure. It's 
just an object sitting in memory. React can walk it however it wants, 
stop whenever it wants, and resume whenever it wants.


# How Fiber Traversal Works

<img src="/blog/fiber/fiber.svg" alt="React UI Runtime" width="800" height="100" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto' }} />

Step 1: Move to the child

When React finishes performing work on a fiber, the first thing it checks is whether that fiber has a child. If it does, that child fiber becomes the next unit of work.

From our example, once React finishes working on the `form` fiber, it moves to its child fiber.

Step 2: Move to the sibling

If a fiber does not have a child, React looks for a sibling fiber.

From the example, the `input` fiber does not have a child, so React moves to its sibling. In the same way, traversal continues through `label`, then down to `span`, and then to `a`.

Step 3: Move upward to find work

If a fiber has neither a child nor a sibling, React moves upward using the return pointer. At this point, React looks for the closest parent fiber that has an unvisited sibling.

From the example, once React reaches a fiber that has no remaining child or sibling to visit, it moves back up to the `form` fiber.

If the parent fiber also does not have a sibling, React keeps moving upward until it reaches the `root` fiber.

Step 4: Stop at the root

Traversal continues until React reaches the root fiber and there are no more fibers left to process.

At that point, the render phase is complete.

# How Time Slicing Actually Works

<img src="/blog/fiber/slice.png" alt="React UI Runtime" width="800" height="100" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto' }} />

Let's say you type in an input box. That triggers a re-render of 500 
search results.

Here's what happens:

_The browser gives React about 5 milliseconds to work._ Not much time.

React starts walking the fiber tree. It processes the first fiber, 
maybe that's your input component. Updates it. Moves to the next fiber 
via the `child` pointer. Processes that. Moves to the next. And the next.

After a few fibers, maybe 10 or 15, React checks the time. "Have I 
been working for 5ms yet?"

If yes, React stops. It doesn't finish the tree. It just... stops. Saves 
a pointer to where it was. Exits the function. The call stack clears.

Now the browser gets control back. It handles any pending events—your 
next keystroke, a scroll, a click. It repaints if needed. Does whatever 
it needs to do.

When the browser is ready, it calls React back. "Hey, you can have 
another 5ms." React picks up the pointer it saved earlier. "Right, I was on fiber 
#15." And continues walking from there. This repeats. React works. Browser breathes. React works. Browser 
breathes. Back and forth, cooperating, until all 500 fibers are 
processed.

Your typing feels instant because the browser handles each keystroke 
within 5ms. React is rendering in the background, in little chunks, 
without blocking you.

# Conclusion

So that’s basically what Fiber is about.

I see some discussions on internet people talking why use fiber architecture, there exist other libraries like vue, solidjs
which use a more reactive approach.

Sure, other frameworks like Vue or SolidJS do it differently. They use reactive signals or fine-grained tracking to only update what actually changes. That's faster in some scenarios, but it comes with its own trade-offs.

React's approach is all about flexibility, predictability, and backward compatibility. Your components stay pure functions of state, your mental model stays simple, and Fiber quietly handles all the messy scheduling.

At the end of the day, React still sticks to its core philosophy.

<img src="/blog/fiber/state.svg" alt="React UI Runtime" width="400" height="100" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto' }} />

The function is the representation of UI of the state.
