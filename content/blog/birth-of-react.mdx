I can't explain everything in this blog but I'll try to keep this short. 
my recommendation would be for you to watch the documentary, it's awesome. all the React core team members
have explained how everything led to creating REACT. from people disliking it to it becoming 
the dominant frontend framework.

But, here's a little story if you wanna read!
React wasn't a very beloved shiny tool at the beginning, there were lots of ups and downs in the journey of React

Back in 2010 Facebook was facing an issue maintaining the UI, the Facebook ads page was
growing massively and it would make a business impact if there was a constant bug

Facebook had complex UI designs, they had the best engineering team working on trying to 
fix the issues. back in the early days there were frameworks like Backbone.js, Ember.js, jQuery etc 

updating UI back then was purely through updating the DOM, which was pretty complicated, tho there
were frameworks like Backbone.js, jQuery etc

Backbone.js - which made writing JavaScript in the MVC architecture
jQuery - improved the experience of working with DOM 

Facebook team created a framework called Bolt.js which was a combination of the different 
philosophies of these frameworks.

Bolt.js alone wouldn't solve the problem they were facing, updating DOM is an expensive
task cause it has to paint the screen, render every pixel. they needed a 
unique solution for the unique problem they were facing

Jordan Walke had interesting new ideas about improving Bolt.js, earlier 
React was called FBolt (functional bolt), an improvement based on Bolt.js

when there is something changing in the UI, completely re-rendering the whole UI was an idea from Jordan Walke.

jumping to the year 2013 when React was open-sourced and first presented at JSConf, people were not 
happy, they didn't like the idea of mixing JS and HTML. Facebook team had a positive expectation but the reaction 
from the people was completely opposite, Facebook team thought React would only live on in the Facebook codebase

But someone outside of Facebook wanted to try React, [@Sophie](https://bsky.app/profile/sophiebits.com). she saw the announcement on Hacker News,
she was building an interactive math question editor for Khan Academy, she decided to try
React for her application in production. she had a really good time using it, later she started 
filing issues and contributing, that sparked the spirit for the React team 

React was a new concept, the React team started spreading the knowledge of React one concept at a time,
one person at a time. later that same year @Pete gave a talk at JSConf  

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>

after that talk people started paying attention, they were willing to try React.
