my recommendation would for you to watch the documentary it's awesome, all react core teams
have explained how everything led to creating REACT. from people disliking it to become 
the dominant frontend framework.

But, here's a little story if you wanna read!

Back in 2010 facebook was facing an issue mainting the issues with UI, facebook ads page was
growing masively and it needed would make a business impact if they would be a constant bug

facebook had a complex UI design's, they had a best engineering team working on trying to 
fix the issues, back in early days there were frameworks like backbone js, amberjs, jQuery etc 

updating UI back then was purely through the updating DOM, which was pretty complicated, tho there
were framework like backbone js, jQuery etc

backbone js- which made writing javascript in the MVC airchitecture
jQuery - improved the expereince of working with DOM 

facebook team created a framework called a boltjs which was a combination of the different 
phyilosphy of these framework and made a framework called boltjs.

Boltjs alone wouldn't solve the problem they were facing, updating DOM is a expensive
task cause it has to paint the screen, render every pixel. they needed something 
unique solution for the unique problem they were facing

jordan walke had a interesting new ideas about the improving the boltjs, eailier 
react was called fbolt (functional bolt) improvement based on the boltjs

when there is something change in the UI completely rendering the whole UI was an idea from the jordan walke.

jumping to the year 2013 when React was opensourced and first presented on the JSconf, people were not 
happy, they didn't like the idea of the mixing JS and HTML. facebook team had an positive expectation but than reaction 
from the people were completely opposite, facebook team thought react would only live off on the facebook codebase

But someone outside of the facebook wanted to try the React, @Shopie, she saw the announcement news on hackernews
she was building an interactive math question editor for the Khans Academy, she decided to try
a react for her application on a production, she had really good time using it later, she used reacted 
and stared filling an issues and contributing, that sparkeld the spirit for the react team 

React was new concept, react team started spreading the knowledge of react at a time, one concept at a time
one person at a time later on same year @pete gave talk in the jsConf

after that talk people started paying attention, they were willing to try react,
