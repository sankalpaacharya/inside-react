import { TweetCard } from "@/components/ui/tweet-card"

A while ago, scrolling Twitter I stumbled upon this Twitter post. I was surprised by this tweet not only because
it's true but also I didn't understand anything he said there much.

<div className='not-prose flex justify-center'> 
<TweetCard 
  id="1997359890021634509" 
  comments={47}
  reposts={177}
  likes={1400}
  bookmarks={999}
/>
</div>
