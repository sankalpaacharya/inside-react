Back in old days, Facebook was getting tractions, hitting thousands and thousands of users, facebook was
popular and a cool trend among people
![facebook](https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-02-at-10.36.06-AM.png)

Facebook wasn't a online shopping app where you would just buy items and leave the site, it was a social 
media platform where lots of people are constantly engaging, chatting viewing profiles, messaging eachother.


During the web1.0 pages where mostly static and it was just like a internet just filled with PDF's 
it was dull and no interaction, Netspace wanted a dynamic behaviour in the browser. everytime we used 
to click buttons or do any interaction that would cause the whole page reload.

Netspace a company had a browser called netspace navigator a dominant early web browser in the mid-1990s, known for popularizing the graphical web and introducing features like JavaScript and cookies
they needed a dynamic behaviour in the browser
netspace navigator 2 was shipped with a javascript, that's how javascript was born

Soon later internet explorer added a support but it was a called a JScript, it was little different implementation
than the netspace. The problem was there was no standarization, Developer would need to write a 
code for one browser and again to make interactive on other they would need to write different javascript.

## ECMA

In 1996 standarization begins, ECMA a non profitable organization made a ECMAScript spec, specsification 
had listed how the javascript should behave not how it should built, so that's the reason we see 
different browser engine nowdays they all follow the ecma spec

In the spec, the **rule for `map`** is described very precisely, step by step. Here’s a simplified version of what it says

> 1. Let `O` be the object the method is called on.
>     
> 2. Let `len` be the length of `O`.
>     
> 3. Let `A` be a new array of length `len`.
>     
> 4. For each index `k` from 0 to `len - 1`:  
>       a. If `O` has a property at `k`, get its value.  
>       b. Call the callback function with the value, index `k`, and `O`.  
>       c. Set `A[k]` to the return value of the callback.
>     
> 5. Return `A`.

It doesn't say how array needs to store variable into an memory, or how to make running loop fast so different company are free 
to create their own permoative engine for their browser, v8 for chrome, spider monkey for firefox
etc so whatever javascript you write will output same in different engine as they follow ecma spec.

during the 1995 javascript came into the picture to make web interactive
things weren't that easy, javascript was elolving 


People were constantly trying to make writing javascript easy, there were we would see the very popular 
library like JQuery.

frontend wasn't easy like it is nowdays things where different, writing javascript was horrible, maintaing 
code was difficult

```html
here the code

<script></script>

```

Before we understand React Internals, let's first get the glimpse of the history of web. Let's not ask question
of *HOW* let's ask *WHY* 

Why the heck we even need React.JS? 

## World Wide Web

The birth of web was during an
