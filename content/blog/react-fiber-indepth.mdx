# Recursive Rendering

React 16 introduced the new reconciliation algorithm, old reconciliation algorithm used to render everything 
recursivly meaning once the rendering process starts there is no way for us to stop it unless it finish the work,
itself now that lead some issues.

say your browser is working on `60fps`, which is 60 frames per seconds, 1 frame in `16.6ms`. your browser 
has to render `1` frame in `16ms`. during this one rendering process it needs to reflow, repaint etc
if your javascript itself takes more than `16ms` or `16ms` it is not giving time for browser to do the work it would drop the 
frame what would lead to janky UI.

I have already written a blog you can check that out, [understanding why react fiber exists](https://inside-react.vercel.app/blog/understanding-why-react-fiber-exists)



# New Reconciliation algorithm

<img src="/blog/scheduler/zoro.svg" alt="React UI Runtime" width="800" height="100" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto' }} />

so with this new reconciliation algorithm react breaks 
the rendering process into a small unit of work, rather doing all rendering process once we perform a rendering 
in a small unit of work in a time slice

React is just like "_I will do the work I can in this time frame(~5ms) and will let the browser do his work_ " once browser finish his work 
it will again let the react know _I'm done with my work, you can continue now_

Now react will resume it's rendering work from the where it had left off. 

so here the `5ms` is not a hard rule but some heuristic value, your browser needs to repaint and go through its own process 
so for the safer side to prevent a frame drop and janky UI it takes the frame interval of `5ms`. 

React also introduced this new data structure called `Fiber`. This data structure hold all information about 
your function, elements, hooks etc
