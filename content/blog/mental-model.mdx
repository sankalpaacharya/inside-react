A lot of confusion of mine got clear when i got the correct mental model for the react, it became much more eaiser for me to understand other concept about react as well and i will share same what i learned 

{/* <img src="/react/confused.svg" alt="Confused face" width="300" height="100" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto' }} /> */}


<img src="/react/youtube.svg" alt="Confused face" width="800" height="100" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto' }} />

We all know react is a UI library but let’s snap back and think what is UI, its is visual surface where we interact, UI consists of buttons, links, colors, image, layouts, icons etc 



for web we have different html tags like button div, a, img etc to create these UI elements and for mobile apps we have native components like View Pressable, scrollview etc for those who are not familiar with mobile development don’t worry they are just like html tags but for mobile app.

no matter if it’s a mobile UI or the web UI they share one common thing that is hierarchy, they both same some tree like structure don’t they? 

```tsx
const a = "sankalpa"
```

in web you see a button, img tag is inside div tag and div tag is inside a body tag.

same for mobile as well we have View component and inside you create pressable component etc

keeping this in mind let’s move forward 

i would like to break react  in two parts one is reconciler and another one is host instance

even if you check the react source code you will see two different package 
	⁃	react-reconciler 
	⁃	react-dom 

these two packages are the one you use in web building websites i will get into why i’m diving the react into two parts

 insert image here from the github repo

this single distinction alone will help us understand later concepts(other blog in series)

this distinction will help us understand how react works

react basically works on two phase one is render phase and one is commit phase(in later blog on this series) 

make a illustration here for better understanding 

reconciliation is basically your render phase and react-dom is the commit phase 

reconciliation is nothing but it’s just a diffing algorithm which checks two dom tree and finds the difference and difference are added are commit into the web

we will discuss about these in later blog post but for now keep in mind it works in two phase

let’s get back to our UI philosophy
