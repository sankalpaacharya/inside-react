React has been dominating frontend for years now. It’s everywhere web apps, 
mobile apps, even TVs. But the crazy thing isn’t just where React runs. It’s 
how everything else started building around it. Whole frameworks exist because of React

To be honest I have been using React for years without even understand what it really is, I knew there exist a react-native
for building mobile apps and there exists a tons of other react libraries for building on different platform. But I never
really tried understood how people are using React on different platforms but my doubt of HOW got clear when i understood
what react truly is. 

if you are little curious to know how react is running on different platform then this blog is for you. 
we build a mental model for what react is and we will unwrap little things here and later we will get glimpse of some core react internal along 
the way



# UI as tree

We all know React is a UI library, but let's step back and think _what exactly *is* UI?_

You might say it's the visual surface we interact with: buttons, links, colors, images, layouts, icons, and more. It consists
of different UI elements.

<img src="/react/apple.png" alt="Apple UI example" width="800" height="100" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto' }} />

For the **web**, we use HTML tags like `<div>`, `<button>`, `<a>`, `<img>` to create UI elements

```html
<div class="card">
  <img src="avatar.png" alt="User" />
  <button>Follow</button>
</div>
```

For **mobile apps**, we have native components like `View`, `Pressable`, and `Text`

```tsx
<View style={styles.card}>
  <Image source={avatar} />
  <Pressable onPress={handleFollow}>
    <Text>Follow</Text>
  </Pressable>
</View>
```


When working with UI we always have this one Pattern in common either you are building a mobile app, web app or anything


No matter if it's mobile or web, they share one common thing: **hierarchy**. Both have a tree-like structure, don't they?

# React for Different Platforms

React is a dominant frontend framework—it's everywhere! We have popular libraries built on React:

- **Next.js** — for server-side rendering
- **React Native** — for mobile applications  
- **React Three Fiber** — for 3D applications
- **Ink** — for terminal applications

Maybe you've used some of these, or just heard of them. But I'm sure you've used React for building web applications—otherwise, why would you be reading this?

Since React Native builds mobile apps and Ink builds terminal apps, we can understand something important: **React is not just for web applications**. If it was only for web, how could people use it for mobile and terminal apps too?

So let's think of React as a **UI Runtime**—it's not just for building web apps, it's for building *any* kind of UI.

Dan Abramov has a great article on this: "React as a UI Runtime"

# The Two Parts of React

I like to break React into two parts:

1. **Reconciler** — the diffing algorithm
2. **Host Instance** — the platform-specific renderer

If you check the React source code, you'll see two key packages:

- `react-reconciler`
- `react-dom`

This distinction helps us understand *why* React works on different platforms. The reconciler is the brain that figures out what changed, while the host instance (like `react-dom` for web or `react-native` for mobile) handles the actual rendering.

Here's an interactive example showing how React state works:

<Sandpack />

We'll explore this more in the next post!
