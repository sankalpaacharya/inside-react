A lot of my confusion cleared up when I developed the correct mental model for React. It became much easier to understand other concepts, and I want to share what I learned.

We all know React is a UI library, but let's step back and think—what exactly *is* UI?

You might say it's the visual surface we interact with: buttons, links, colors, images, layouts, icons, and more.

# What is UI?

<img src="/react/apple.png" alt="Apple UI example" width="800" height="100" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto' }} />

For the **web**, we use HTML tags like `<div>`, `<button>`, `<a>`, `<img>` to create UI elements

```html
<div class="card">
  <img src="avatar.png" alt="User" />
  <button>Follow</button>
</div>
```

For **mobile apps**, we have native components like `View`, `Pressable`, and `Text`

```tsx
<View style={styles.card}>
  <Image source={avatar} />
  <Pressable onPress={handleFollow}>
    <Text>Follow</Text>
  </Pressable>
</View>
```

For those unfamiliar with mobile development—don't worry! These are just like HTML tags, but for mobile apps.

No matter if it's mobile or web, they share one common thing: **hierarchy**. Both have a tree-like structure, don't they?

# React for Different Platforms

React is a dominant frontend framework—it's everywhere! We have popular libraries built on React:

- **Next.js** — for server-side rendering
- **React Native** — for mobile applications  
- **React Three Fiber** — for 3D applications
- **Ink** — for terminal applications

Maybe you've used some of these, or just heard of them. But I'm sure you've used React for building web applications—otherwise, why would you be reading this?

Since React Native builds mobile apps and Ink builds terminal apps, we can understand something important: **React is not just for web applications**. If it was only for web, how could people use it for mobile and terminal apps too?

So let's think of React as a **UI Runtime**—it's not just for building web apps, it's for building *any* kind of UI.

Dan Abramov has a great article on this: "React as a UI Runtime"

<img src="/react/apple.png" alt="React UI Runtime" width="800" height="100" style={{ display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto' }} />

# The Two Parts of React

I like to break React into two parts:

1. **Reconciler** — the diffing algorithm
2. **Host Instance** — the platform-specific renderer

If you check the React source code, you'll see two key packages:

- `react-reconciler`
- `react-dom`

This distinction helps us understand *why* React works on different platforms. The reconciler is the brain that figures out what changed, while the host instance (like `react-dom` for web or `react-native` for mobile) handles the actual rendering.

We'll explore this more in the next post!
